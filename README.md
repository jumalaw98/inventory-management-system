## About

### Description
Our submission is an inventory management system designed with Figma, Refine React for the front-end, Tailwind CSS for styling, Rails for the back-end, and a Postgres database. The system has a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system that allows users to manage their inventory data effortlessly.
1. Responsive design: Refine enabled us to develop a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, guaranteeing that users can access the system on computers, tablets, and mobile devices.
2. Customized components: Refine offered us with a variety of customisable components, such as tables, forms, and charts, which enabled us to develop an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.
3. Data visualization: We were able to use Refine to generate interactive charts and graphs to assist users in visualizing their inventory data, making it easier to discover trends and patterns. 
4. Filters and search: Refine provides us with built-in filters and search capability, allowing users to find inventory data quickly and efficiently. 
5. Authentication and authorization: Refine provides us with a secure authentication and authorization system, allowing us to limit access to sensitive data and ensuring that only authorized users may view and edit inventory data.

### The Design Process
#### Introduction

The purpose of this section is to explain the inclusive design process used in creating an inventory app. Inclusive design aims to create products that are accessible and usable for people with diverse abilities, backgrounds, and cultures. This design process involves considering the needs of a wide range of users and ensuring that everyone can benefit from the product, regardless of their physical, cognitive, or sensory abilities.

#### Design Process

The following are the steps involved in the inclusive design process of the inventory app and these are the [design files](https://www.figma.com/file/1CbMZeGmHGnztb0BFfs9Yd/Inventory-Management-Dashboard?node-id=0%3A1&t=g75j9Uy1QfdCLiC3-1):

- **Conducting user research**: The first step was to understand the needs and requirements of different types of users. This involved conducting surveys, interviews, and focus groups to gather insights and feedback from people with different abilities and backgrounds.

- **Defining user personas**: Based on the user research, we defined user personas to represent different types of users and their needs and preferences. This helped us to prioritize and focus on the most important design considerations.

- **Accessibility testing**: Throughout the design process, we tested the app with users who have different abilities and disabilities to ensure that it was usable and accessible. This involved conducting user testing sessions with people who use assistive technologies, such as screen readers and magnifiers, as well as people with motor, visual, and hearing impairments.

- **Usability testing**: In addition to accessibility testing, we also conducted usability testing to evaluate the overall usability of the app. This involved testing the app with a representative sample of users to see how well they could complete tasks and achieve their goals.

- **Design iterations**: Based on the feedback from accessibility and usability testing, we iterated on the design of the app to address any issues or problems. This involved making changes to the layout, navigation, and functionality of the app to ensure that it was usable and accessible for all users.

- **Final design**: The final design of the inventory app was the result of multiple iterations and refinements, based on the feedback and insights gathered from users throughout the design process.

#### Conclusion

The inclusive design process used in creating the inventory app involved considering the needs and requirements of a wide range of users, and ensuring that everyone can benefit from the product, regardless of their physical, cognitive, or sensory abilities. By conducting user research, defining user personas, and conducting accessibility and usability testing, we were able to create an app that is accessible and usable for all users.
